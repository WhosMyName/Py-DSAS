## Jet another Dark Souls Auto Save

#### Backstory:
A former co-worker of mine saw my olde [DSAS](https://github.com/WhosMyName/DSAS) and said:  
"In python, I could do this in less than 50 lines of code!"  
That was basically the reason to look into and learn python.  
Well, now imma shitty wannabe python dev, so I came back to do this in less than 50 LOC.  
It's like ~80 LOC, but it handles *all*

</sup> Dark Souls Versions and has a dynamic timer.
